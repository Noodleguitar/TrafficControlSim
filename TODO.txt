HIGH priority:
x Last car in queue does not brake enough when light goes green
- After some time simulating, cars start to run red lights for some reason.
- Make sure cars entering away-lanes are not counted towards reaching destinations.
x Remove cars from lane when switching to another
- Allowing multiple green lights simultaneously
    - Intersection blocking should not be either fully blocked or open

LOW priority:
- Create Render class
- Vector class for easier mathing
- Rotating cars instead of reloading image (allowing non-uniform scaling of vehicles)
